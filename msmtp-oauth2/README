Fork of https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/msmtp-oauth2/

Because I have 2 accounts in msmtp - one Gmail one that must use this hack, and
another that needs to us regular `PLAIN` auth and is therefore *broken* by this
hack.

So this fork adjusts this to install the just the binary as `msmtp-oauth2`.

## Building & Installing
