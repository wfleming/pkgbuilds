At Code Climate, a bunch of things interact with the docker daemon. Newer
docker versions compiled with newer Go versions get unhappy when older clients
compiled with older go versions try to talk to them, and throw errors about
invalid host headers.

So this is a pkgbuild to compile a given docker version with go 1.5 to keep
everything happy.

1. Downgrade relevant dependencies

  ```
  $ downgrade go # choose the latest 1.5.x version
  $ downgrade binutils # choose 2.26.1
  ```

  Recommend that you choose to add both of those packages to `IgnorePkg` when
  prompted.

2. ./rebuild.sh
